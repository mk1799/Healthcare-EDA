**Sources of Data:**

* Insurance coverage before and after the ACA from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hhs/health-insurance)

* Historical Health Insurance Access from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/health-care-access-coverage)

* Population estimates by the [US Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml)

*Note: the master branch is redundant, it has been kept temporarily as good practice. The default branch has been set up as gh-pages, so that the report from the analysis can be rendered on Github pages.*
